## 🔍 **Project Overview**
The AR Smart Navigation Campus project leverages AR technology to provide users with real-time, interactive navigation within a campus environment. The project aims to solve common navigation challenges in large and complex spaces by overlaying digital information on the physical environment.

## 🚀 **Usage**
After installing the application on an Android device:

1.  Launch the app and grant necessary permissions (e.g., camera, location).
2.  Use the navigation menu to select a location or view detailed information about a specific area on the campus.
3.  Follow the AR-based navigation cues to reach your destination.

## 🧩 **Architecture**
The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase.

**Key Components:**
+ **Model**: Manages data and business logic, interacting with Firestore for data persistence.
+ **View**: UI components, including fragments and activities that display data to the user.
+ **ViewModel**: Acts as a mediator between the View and Model, handling UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.

## ✨ **Features** 
+ **AR-Based Navigation**: Provides users with augmented reality guidance within the campus.
+ **Dynamic Location Management**: Allows administrators to add, update, and delete location data in real-time.
+ **Interactive UI**: Users can interact with the AR environment to get more information about specific locations.
+ **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various Android devices and screen sizes.
